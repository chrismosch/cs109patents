Explanation of Data</h1>


<p>
Each table displays a list of assigned owners (assignees) and associated 'utility patent' counts for a selected NAICS
Industry Classification category. 'Utility patents' are also known as 'patents for inventions'. 
In the tables listing patent assignees, entries are listed in order of decreasing total patent counts for the period. 
Annual patent counts are displayed for each year of the time period. Assignee data in this report are limited to
utility patents granted since 1969 because assignee data contained in the TAF database, used as the data source for these 
tables, is limited to utility patents granted since 1969.
</p>

<p>
The report tables count patents in two ways, using a "fractional count" method and a "whole count" 
method that are discussed in more detail in a separate section, below. Some tables are 
provided that distribute patent grants by the year of grant and other tables are provided 
that distribute the <strong>same patent grants</strong> by the year of application. These
different distributions of the same patents are further discussed in another separate 
section, below.
</p>

<p>
NAICS industry categories that are profiled in these tables consist of 30 categories that 
are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). 
There are 26 unique categories, and 4 categories that are combinations or roll-ups of 
the 26 unique categories. In addition, an 'All Industries' category table, consisting 
of all NAICS categories together, is included. 
In the report tables, each roll-up NAICS category is identified as a '*** ROLLUP ***' in the 
NAICS classification title. A listing of the NAICS categories is included in a table, below.
See the text below for additional discussion of the NAICS 
categories and how patents have been associated with those categories.
</p>

<p>
Patent ownership information reflects ownership at the time of patent grant and does not include subsequent changes in ownership. 
Assignee mergers and ownership changes that occur after patent grant are not recorded in the TAF database and are not reflected 
in the table counts.  If more than one assignee was declared at the time of grant, patent ownership is 
attributed to the first-named assignee.
No attempt has been made to combine data based on subsidiary relationships. However, where possible, spelling variations and 
variations based on name changes (e.g., ESSO to EXXON) have been merged into a single name. While every effort is made to 
accurately identify all organizational entities and to report data by a single organizational name, achievement of a totally 
clean record is not expected, particularly in view of the many variations that may occur in corporate identifications.
</p>

<p>
Note that some tables include an assignee entry labeled, "~INDIVIDUALLY OWNED PATENT". This entry includes (1) patents 
for which ownership was unassigned at the time of grant and (2) patents for which ownership was assigned to an individual 
at the time of grant (i.e., ownership assignment was not made to an organization).
</p>

<p>
Various aspects of the these and other tables in the report are discussed below. The text that follows has been extracted
from the General Description of the Report.

<h2><a name="overview">Brief Overview</a></h2>

<p>
This report, prepared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
Patent Technology Monitoring Team (PTMT), profiles U.S. patenting in 30 product fields 
(26 unique fields, and several fields that are combinations or roll-ups of the 26 
unique fields) that are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System 
(NAICS). Patenting activity in the NAICS industry categories has been determined by the 
primary U.S. Patent Classification System (USPC) classification assigned to each patent
and a USPC to NAICS concordance.
</p>

<p>
This report presents various tables that display patenting activity by NAICS category,
state and country of origin, ownership category, and first-named assignee (assigned owner). 
The report tables count patents in two ways, using a "fractional count" method and a "whole count" 
method that are discussed in more detail in a separate section, below. Some tables are 
provided that distribute patent grants by the year of grant and other tables are provided 
that distribute the <strong>same patent grants</strong> by the year of application. These
different distributions of the same patents are further discussed in another separate 
section, below.
</p>

<p>
Patent data presented in this report have been obtained from the USPTO Technology
Assessment and Forecast (TAF) database that is administered by PTMT. The TAF database includes 
selected bibliographic data for 5.4 million U.S. utility patents issued since 1963 and 483,000 
non-utility patents issued since 1977 (this count excludes published patent applications).  
While every effort is made to ensure accurate data for all patents, the size and complexity of 
the database prevent achievement of a totally "clean" record.
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
<h2>PLEASE NOTE !</h2>
<p>
<strong>USPTO staff are not classifying U.S. patents directly into NAICS industry categories.</strong>
The distribution of patent counts by NAICS industry category, as displayed in this report,
is determined using a very general concordance between two substantially different classification 
systems, the U.S. Patent Classification System and the North American Industry Classification 
System. 
</p>

<p>
As such, the patent counts associated with each of the different NAICS categories should be viewed
with caution and may serve only as a very general indicator of the patenting activity in those 
categories.
</p>

<h2><a name="pats_included">Patents Included in the Report</a></h2>
<p>
This report counts 'utility patents' granted by USPTO from 1963 to 2012. 'Utility patents'
are also known as 'patents for inventions'. Plant patents and design patents are not counted in this report.
Assignee (assigned owner) breakouts are limited to 'utility patents' granted since 1969.
</p>


<h2><a name="NAICS_Cats_Rollups">NAICS Industry Categories and Roll-ups</a></h2>
<p>
NAICS industry categories that are profiled in this report consist of 30 categories that 
are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). 
There are 26 unique categories, and 4 categories that are combinations or roll-ups of 
the 26 unique categories. In addition, an 'All Industries' category, consisting 
of all NAICS categories together, is included in the report. 
</p>

<p>
In the report tables, each roll-up category is identified as a '*** ROLLUP ***' in the 
NAICS classification title. A listing of the NAICS categories is included in a table, below.
</p>


<h2><a name="assoc_pats_w_naics">Associating of U.S. Patents with NAICS Industry Categories</a></h2>
<p>
Patents have been associated with NAICS industry categories using the primary U.S. Patent Classification 
System (USPC) classification assigned to each patent and a USPC to NAICS concordance.
</p>

<p>
U.S. patents are classified in one or more classifications of the U.S. Patent Classification System (USPC) according to 
the content and claimed subject matter contained in the patents. For each patent, one of these classifications is designated 
as the primary classification of the patent (called the patent's 'original' classification, in USPTO-specific terminology), 
and the remainder, if any, are designated as 'cross-reference' classifications. <strong>Each patent has one and only one primary
classification. In this report, only a patent's primary or 'original' classification is considered in the determination 
the patent's associated NAICS category or categories.</strong> Patent classification information in this report reflects the USPC 
as it existed on 31 December 2012. Note that frequent expansion and changes have occured in the USPC to accommodate 
changing technologies. As a result, a patent may have been periodically reclassified into new classifications. Thus, 
the current, primary classification associated with a patent may have changed over time and may not be the same classification 
as was assigned at the time of grant.
</p>

<p>
In the tables that display utility patent activity by NAICS industry category, patent counts 
for each NAICS category are determined by using the primary classification associated with each patent and a concordance 
between the USPC and NAICS. The USPC to NAICS Concordance assigns USPC patent classifications to all (up to seven) identified 
NAICS-based categories to which they are pertinent. This procedure results, in most cases, in the inclusion of the majority 
of patents relevant to the NAICS category and few, if any, irrelevant patents. However, since the match between the 
USPC and NAICS is imperfect, the tables cannot be considered to include all relevant patents, nor to exclude all irrelevant 
patents. For an invention relating to a  product or apparatus, the NAICS category identified by the concordance is based 
primarily on the type of establishment that would be engaged in producing the product or apparatus. For an invention relating
to a process, it first is determined if the process is associated more with the product or with the apparatus and then the 
previously noted rule is applied. More detail about the Concordance may be found in 

<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/data/misc/patenting_trends/otaf_concordance_review_Jan1985.pdf">
<em>Review and Assessment of the OTAF Concordance between the U.S. Patent Classification and the Standard Industrial Classification System: Final 
Report, OTAF, 1984</em></a> (image copy only), available from PTMT. 

Note that the USPC to NAICS concordance is largely based on the 
USPC to Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) Concordance that preceded it. NAICS has replaced the SIC. The USPC to NAICS
Concordance file is available for 
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/data/naics_conc/">
download on the USPTO Web Site (USPC to NAICS Concordance)</a>. Older USPC to SIC Concordance files are also available for

</p>


<h2><a name="frac_and_whole">Fractional Counts and Whole Counts</a></h2>
<p>
This report contains separate sets of 'Fractional Count' tables and 'Whole Count' tables. These separate sets of tables 
count patents in different ways.
</p>

<p>
The 'Fractional Count' tables divide each patent equally between the NAICS categories that correspond
to the patent's primary classification, as determined by the USPC to NAICS concordance. In the 'Fractional Count' 
tables, for example, if a patent has primary classification in a USPC classification that is matched to 3 unique NAICS 
categories, then that patent is counted as 1/3 (one-third) of a patent in each of the three associated NAICS categories. Because 
of this equal, proportional division of patent counts between the matched NAICS categories, the sum of the patent counts in the 26 unique
NAICS categories for a year will equal the total number of patents for that year, as displayed in the 'All Industries'
category breakout (subject to mostly minor rounding differences). Similarly, patent counts for a NAICS roll-up category (e.g., NAICS 336) 
for a period will equal the sum of the patents of its component categories (e.g., 3361-3369) for that period, again subject 
to mostly minor rounding differences. Note that in the tables, 'fractional' patent counts have been rounded to the nearest integer. 
</p>

<p>
Except for mostly minor differences due to rounding, the unique NAICS category counts in the 'Fractional Count' tables also 
should sum to the totals displayed in most other PTMT utility patent statistics reports applied to the same time periods. 
</p>

<p>
In the 'Whole Count' tables, when a patent has a primary classification in a USPC that is matched to more than one NAICS 
category, that patent is counted once in each of the matched NAICS categories. In the 'Whole Count' tables, for example, 
if a patent has primary classification in a USPC classification that is matched to 3 unique NAICS categories, then a full 
patent count is added to each of the three associated NAICS categories. Consequently, that single patent results in 
an effective total count of 3 patents when the three NAICS categories are summed together. For this reason, <strong>in the 'Whole Count' 
tables, PTMT strongly suggests that users avoid summing patent counts from different NAICS categories</strong> since such sums will result in 
some patents being counted multiple times (i.e., double counting of patents is likely). In the 'Whole Count' tables, 
a single patent may be fully counted in as many as seven unique NAICS categories. While the summing of 'whole' counts across 
different NAICS categories should be avoided due to the possibility of counting a patent multiple times, note that within 
a table, counts displayed in each individual 'Whole Counts' category represent counts of unique patents (i.e., each patent 
is counted only once).
</p>

<p>
For most general analyses, use of the 'Fractional Count' tables is suggested. However, 'Whole Count' tables can be helpful in 
determining the full extent of patenting activity in a single NAICS category. In cases where there is a need to sum counts across 
more than one NAICS category, the 'Fractional Count' tables are likely to be preferred since the use of 'Fractional Count' tables 
should avoid the possibility of counting the same patents multiple times.
</p>


<h2><a name="distribution">Distribution By Year of Grant and By Year of Application</a></h2>

<p>
Selected tables in this report distribute patent counts by the year in which the patents were granted. 
Other tables distribute the <strong>same patent counts</strong> by the year in which patents were were 
filed (i.e., the year of application).
</p>

<p>
The distribution of patent grants by the year in which the patents were granted is significant since the year of 
grant indicates when patent protection for an invention was obtained.
</p>

<p>
The distribution of patent grants by the year in which they were filed also can be useful in analyses of patent activity, 
It should be noted, however, that <strong>DATA FOR THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT WERE FILED BUT NEVER ISSUED (HISTORICALLY ABOUT 
35% OF TOTAL FILINGS) ARE NOT INCLUDED IN ANY TABLES IN THIS REPORT</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Tables that display patent counts, as distributed by their year of application, are of significant value since
the date that an application was filed more accurately reflects when the technology was developed.
Additionally, fluctuations in patent data distributed by application date are much more likely to
reflect changes in technological activity since such fluctuations, for the most part, would be less affected
by changes in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) processing such as occurred in years such as 1986
when the USPTO issued fewer patents than would normally have been expected due to a lack of funds.
Note that a patent's "pendency" can be quite variable from one patent to another thereby
affecting the date of patent grant. Such variation in pendency is determined by many factors, including
USPTO workload (which varies between technologies), budget and manpower levels, patent printing schedules,
etc.
</p>

<p>
  Since the average time period between the filing for a patent and the issuing
  of the patent (i.e., a patent's "pendency") is about 32 months for utility patents, many of the applications
  filed prior to 2004 were still pending on December 31, 2012, the cutoff date for patents
  included in this report. As a result, the patent counts displayed for the years 2004 to 2012 in the
  tables that distribute counts 'by year of patent application' are incomplete and will increase in the 
  future as patent applications filed during those later years are patented in 2013 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  As of 12/31/2012, utility patent data, as distributed by year of application, are approximately approximately 95%
  complete for utility patent applications filed in 2004, 89% complete for applications filed in 2005, 80%
  complete for applications filed in 2006, 67% complete for applications filed in 2007, 49% complete for
  applications filed in 2008, 36% complete for applications filed in 2009, and 19% complete for applications
  filed in 2010; data are essentially complete for applications filed prior to 2004.
</p>


<h2><a name="origin">Origin</a></h2>
<p>
In the tables that display patent origin, origin corresponds to 'geographic' origin. Origin is grouped into 'U.S.' 
and 'Foreign' origin categories and is determined by the residence of the first-named inventor at the time of 
grant, as displayed on the patent. Within each category, geographic regions are listed in order of decreasing 
total patent counts for the period. Annual patent counts are displayed for each year of the time period.
</p>

<p>
Please note that geographic names that appear in this report do not imply any expression of opinion by USPTO 
about the preferred name or the legal status of any country or territory, or of its authorities.
</p>


<h2><a name="ownership">Ownership Category</a></h2>
<p>
In the tables that list patent ownership, ownership is grouped into 'U.S.' and 'Foreign' ownership categories.
Annual patent counts are displayed for each year of the time period.
</p>

<p>
Patent ownership, e.g., 'U.S. Corporation Owned', is determined by the assignment of ownership at the time of grant
and corresponds to the information that appears on the patent, usually on the patent's front page. In cases of multiple assigned 
owners (i.e., assignees), the patent ownership category is attributed to that of the first-named assignee. If 
patent ownership is unassigned, ownership category is identified as 'Individual'. Assignee mergers, assignee name 
changes, and ownership changes that occur after patent grant are not recorded in the TAF database and are not 
reflected in the table counts.  
</p>

<p>
'Corporation' ownership categories correspond to assignees that are non-government organizations.  While the 
majority of these non-government organizations are corporate entities, the term also includes organizations such as 
small businesses, universities, research foundations, and nonprofit institutions. 'U.S. Government' ownership
corresponds to ownership by the U.S. Federal Government but 'Foreign Government' ownership is not necessarily restricted 
to national or sub-national government entities. 'Individual' ownership categories correspond to both patents for 
which ownership was unassigned at the time of grant and patents for which ownership was assigned to an individual.
</p>

<p>
The determination of an ownership category as 'U.S.' or 'Foreign' is based on the address provided at the time of grant 
for the first-named assignee or, in the case of patents with unassigned ownership, the first-named inventor.
</p>


<h2><a name="assignee">Assignees (Assigned Owners)</a></h2>
<p>
 Patent ownership information reflects ownership at the time of patent grant and does not include subsequent changes in ownership. 
 Assignee mergers and ownership changes that occur after patent grant are not recorded in the TAF database and are not reflected 
 in the table counts.  If more than one assignee was declared at the time of grant, patent ownership is 
 attributed to the first-named assignee.
</p>

<p>
No attempt has been made to combine data based on subsidiary relationships. However, where possible, spelling variations and 
variations based on name changes (e.g., ESSO to EXXON) have been merged into a single name. While every effort is made to 
accurately identify all organizational entities and to report data by a single organizational name, achievement of a totally 
clean record is not expected, particularly in view of the many variations that may occur in corporate identifications.
</p>

<p>
Note that some tables include an assignee entry labeled, "~INDIVIDUALLY OWNED PATENT". This entry includes (1) patents 
for which ownership was unassigned at the time of grant and (2) patents for which ownership was assigned to an individual 
at the time of grant (i.e., ownership assignment was not made to an organization).
</p>

<p>
In the tables listing patent assignees, entries are listed in order of decreasing total patent counts for the period. 
Annual patent counts are displayed for each year of the time period. Assignee data in this report are limited to
utility patents granted since 1969 because assignee data contained in the TAF database, used as the data source for this 
report, is limited to utility patents granted since 1969.
