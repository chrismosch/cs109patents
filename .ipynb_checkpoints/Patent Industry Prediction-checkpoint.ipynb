    "The purpose of this notebook is to automate the downloading, unpacking, and subsequent uploading (to S3) of patent data available on Google. We scrape patent files with supplements and images from the url found in the User Guide. The data is grouped by weeks, ranging from 2001 to 2015. The years 2011- are compressed in .tar format, while the earlier ones are compressed as .zip. Thus, the code accounts for these options by including the python libraries ZipFile and TarFile. \n",
    "The code found in Compact Version (which we used mainly) downloads a single week of patent data, extracts, uploads and deletes it before repeating the process with another week. This is optimized to work on very small storage space such as an SSD on our local machine.\n",
    "Each week of patent data contains several folders with different content. For the purposes of our project, we are only interested in the abstracts, which are found in the .xml files of the patent application body. Thus, we need to get rid of all supplements (as defined by the user below) and all images that aren't conducive to data analysis. This is reflected in the main Code, where the tree of the downloaded data is searched for all unwanted folders, which are deleted.\n",
    "It is important to realize that the \"deleted\" files are typically dropped into the recycle bin of the local machine, and thus the purpose of running the space-optimized code is compromised. Therefore we advise the user to us an automated recycle bin clean-up program. It should be set to clean every 10-15 minutes, which is the average time it takes to complete the cycle for one week of patent data.\n",
    "Since we get rid of most of the data found in the patent files, the convoluted folder structure that remains is thrown out and replaced by a three-tiered one: 1) Root 2) Year 3) Week.\n",
    "The uploading to S3 is controlled by the boto3 library, which takes care of most of the uploading automatically.\n",
